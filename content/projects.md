#### MEP API
<div style="text-align: justify">
I developed the MEP API Python package to facilitate the scraping of individual data on members of
the European Parliament from the EP website. It namely provides easy access to MEPs' history in the EP,
their meetings with special interest group representatives as well as most of the personal information
available through the EP website.
