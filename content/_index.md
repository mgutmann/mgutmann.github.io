## About Me
{{< figure class="avatar" src="/avatar.jpg" >}}

<div style="text-align: justify">

I am currently a senior at Columbia University, majoring in
Economics - Mathematics as part of the Columbia - Sciences Po
dual BA program. In Paris, I studied social science at Sciences Po
and mathematics at Sorbonne Université (formerly Univerité Pierre et Marie Curie)
as part of the Science/Social Science undergraduate dual degree program.

I am very interested in economic research, particularly in industrial organization, economic history
and political economy. I am also very interested in the applications of Natural Language Processing 
for data mining in economics. I will be applying for PhD/MA Programs in Economics and Pre-Doctoral
research positions in economics in the Fall of 2021.

Outside academia, I am passionate about landscape and architecture photography
as well as good coffee.
