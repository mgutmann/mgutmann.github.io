## About Me
{{< figure class="avatar" src="/avatar.jpg" >}}

<div style="text-align: justify">

I am currently a Pre-Doctoral Research Assistant within the Applied Economics group at the MIT Sloan School of Management.Previously, I was a student at Columbia University, majoring in Economics - Mathematics as part of the Columbia - Sciences Po dual BA program. In Paris, besides Sciences Po, I also studied mathematics at Sorbonne Université (formerly Univerité Pierre et Marie Curie).

I am very interested in economic research, particularly in industrial organization, economic history and political economy. I am also very interested in the applications of Natural Language Processing for data mining in economics. 

Outside academia, I am passionate about landscape and architecture photography as well as good coffee.
