## About Me
{{< figure class="avatar" src="/avatar.jpg" >}}

<div style="text-align: justify">

I am currently a senior at Columbia University, majoring in
Economics - Mathematics as part of the Columbia - Sciences Po
dual BA program. In Paris, besides Sciences Po, I also studied
mathematics at Sorbonne Université (formerly Univerité Pierre et Marie Curie).

I am very interested in economic research, particularly in industrial organization, spatial economics,
economic history and political economy. I am also very interested in the applications of Natural Language 
Processing for data mining in economics. 

I am currently applying to Pre-Doctoral research positions in Economics to start work in the summer of 2022.

Outside academia, I am passionate about landscape and architecture photography
as well as good coffee.
